**Note:** This repository only contains the frontend code for the Discover app. The backend code is not included, as it is hosted on MongoDB Atlas App Services, and we do not want to share code tied to a cloud service.

## Dependencies

This project uses several React libraries, which are listed in the `package.json` file. These libraries are not part of our codebase, and their respective licenses can be found within their documentation.

## Project Submission and Licensing

This is a project submission for the Discover Music App. The `create-react-app` with PWA template generates some boilerplate code which is included in this project. Apart from the boilerplate code and the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, all other code in this repository is entirely ours.
