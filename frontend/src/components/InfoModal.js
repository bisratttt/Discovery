            We got the idea for Discover from two popular apps -{" "}
            <a
              href="https://bereal.com/en"
              target="_blank"

            >
              BeReal
            </a>
            , which lets you send photos to friends once a day at a random time,
            and{" "}
            <a
              href="https://www.wishroll.co/"

              Kiwi
            </a>
            , which lets you discover music by sending songs to friends. We
            wanted to combine the best of both worlds - the excitement of
            discovering something new every day and the joy of sharing it with
            others.
